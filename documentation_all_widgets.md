# Documentation: Custom Orange3 Widgets

This document details the functionality, design choices, and usage guidelines for the custom widgets suite.

## 1. LightGBM Optuna Widget

## 2. GMM Clustering Widget (Gaussian Mixture Models)

### Overview
This widget implements **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** and **Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM)** for clustering. Unlike standard K-Means, GMM assigns data points to clusters probabilistically (soft clustering), allowing for elliptical cluster shapes.

### Key Features
*   **Hungarian Mapping**: If ground-truth class labels are present, the widget calculates the optimal 1-to-1 mapping between discovered clusters and true classes using the Hungarian algorithm (Linear Sum Assignment). This transforms the unsupervised clustering task into a supervised classification evaluation automatically.
*   **Auto-Tune**: Can automatically select the optimal number of components ($k$) by minimizing **BIC** (Bayesian Information Criterion) or **AIC**.
*   **Bayesian GMM**: Supports Dirichlet Process priors to infer the effective number of active components automatically from a larger upper bound.
*   **Covariance Control**: Allows selection of covariance types (`full`, `tied`, `diag`, `spherical`) to constrain cluster shapes.

### Usage Logic
1.  **Scaling**: By default, applies `StandardScaler` internally. This is crucial for GMM convergence.
2.  **Mapping**: Enable "Optimal cluster-to-class mapping" only if your data typically comes with ground truth (e.g., for testing clustering capability on labeled data).
3.  **Auto-tune vs Fixed**: Use auto-tune to explore detailed structures; use fixed $k$ when you have domain knowledge (e.g., 2 market regimes).

## 3. HMM Clustering Widget (Hidden Markov Models)

### Overview
The HMM widget applies **Hidden Markov Models** to time-series or sequential data. It assumes that the observed data is generated by a sequence of hidden states that transition between each other with certain probabilities.

### Key Features
*   **Temporal Context**: Unlike GMM or K-Means, HMM respects the order of data rows. It groups "periods" of time into states (e.g., "Bull Market" vs "Bear Market").
*   **Multithreaded Training**: Training HMMs can be computationally expensive. This widget runs the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in a **background thread**, preventing the UI from freezing.
*   **Visual Output**: Annotates the input data with `HMM_state` (the most likely hidden state) and `HMM_confidence` (probability of that state).

### Best Practices
*   **Sort your data**: Ensure input data is strictly time-ordered before feeding it to this widget.
*   **Stationarity**: HMMs assume transition matrices are constant. If market dynamics change structurally over decades, a single HMM might struggle.
*   **States**: Start with 2 or 3 states for financial data (e.g., Low Vol/Up, High Vol/Down).

## 4. ZigZag & Trend Widget

### Overview
A technical analysis widget that filters noise from time-series price data to identify significant "Swings" or trends.

### Key Features
*   **ZigZag Algorithm**: Identifies local peaks and valleys that deviate from the previous extreme by at least a specified **Swing Percentage**.
*   **Trend Identification**: Generates a `Trend` column (+1 for Uptrend, -1 for Downtrend) based on the current swing direction.
*   **Noise Filtering**: Ignores moves smaller than `swing %`, making it ideal for labeling training data for trading algorithms (e.g., "classify this bar as part of an Uptrend").

### Usage
- **Input**: Connect a dataset with a Price column (Close, High, Low, etc.).
- **Parameters**: 
    - **Swing %**: The threshold for a reversal. Larger values (e.g., 5-10%) capture major trends; smaller values (1-2%) capture minor corrections.
- **Output**: Returns the original data augmented with `ZigZag` (pivot points) and `Trend` features.

## 5. Yahoo Finance Widget

### Overview
A data ingestion utility that downloads full historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data directly from Yahoo Finance.

### Key Features
*   **Threaded Download**: Downloads run asynchronously, ensuring the application remains responsive even when fetching decades of daily data.
*   **Robust Parsing**: Implements "Case-Insensitive" and "Structure-Agnostic" parsing to handle variations in the `yfinance` API response (e.g., changing from MultiIndex to flat columns).
*   **Automatic Formatting**: Converts date columns and ensures numeric types are ready for Orange pipelines immediately.
